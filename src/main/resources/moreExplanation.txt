Dear students,

In the project, you are requested to create the third implementation as follows.

Read and write are implemented as in step (1), except that now you equip your streams
with a buffer of size B in internal memory. Whenever the buffer becomes empty/full
the next B characters are read/written from/to the file.

I would like to clarify that "implemented as in step (1)" means that you should use the same system calls / library calls as in implementation (1), but now fill an entire buffer of B characters whenever you make the system call instead of reading one character at a time per system call. Then, you can search for the next newline character in the in-memory buffer that you have just read. And similarly for writing.  [Attention: you also have to take border cases into account where a single line is split across two buffers.]

I hope that this clarifies the third implementation.
